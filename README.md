# GetBack Minecraft Plugin
#### Easily come back to your death place in Minecraft

This plugin is a drop-in replacement and update for [BackAgain](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/backagain), since it seems to be no longer updated.

Like the original plugin allows you to teleport back to the place where you died.
